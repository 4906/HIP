# Hexagonal Iso-Path
HIP is an original board game created by youtuber [pocket83](https://www.youtube.com/user/pocket83). Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz6q03b8R6U) to see his explanation of the game, its rules, and how to make a physical version from scratch. Huge thanks to Red Blob Games for [this tutorial](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons) on hex grid coordinate systems.
